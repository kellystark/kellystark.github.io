                <h3>Book One</h3>
                <p id="info">Left alone in this world when her father dies, eighteen-year-old Faith learns that he took an ancient truth to the grave, a truth that would have explained the history of her bloodline and the role it plays in a wager between God and Satan.</p> 

                <p>Now destiny is calling, demanding that Faith toss aside her disbelief and face reality, there is a Heaven and a Hell. And once she's exposed to the existence of the other side and a responsibility she's meant to fulfill, she learns that being a pawn in an unholy game comes with no escape route.</p>

                <p id="info">Faith has to put her torn affection for the two angelic brothers aside, as Kort and Seth reappear in her life, bringing news of a new threat against humanity: an ex-archangel hit squad scrambling to break through to this world, the infamous IRIN. Kort and Seth will also have to learn to get along, because the leader of the IRIN has his sight set on one thing ... Faith. And he’ll hunt her down until he can take over her power of mankind, or her virtue, whichever comes first.</p>
